## Data Structures

* [String](string.md) - String is a sequence of characters. and it is immutable.
* [Array](array.md) - Array maintains a collection of elements in a contiguous memory location. It is a dynamic data structure that can grow and shrink as needed.
* [Linked list](linked-list.md) - Linked list is a linear data structure. It is a collection of nodes which are connected by a sequence of pointers. Each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node. The last node points to null.
* [Stack](stack.md) - Stack is a linear data structure. It is a collection of elements which can be added or removed only at one end. The last element is the first element to be removed.
* [Queue](queue.md) - Queue is a linear data structure. It is a collection of elements which can be added or removed only at one end. The first element is the first element to be removed.
* [Binary tree](binary-tree.md) - Binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children. The left child is always less than the parent and the right child is always greater than the parent.
* [Binary search tree](binary-search-tree.md) - Binary search tree is a binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of the node's left child and less than or equal to the value of the node's right child.
* [Heap](heap.md) - Heap is a data structure that is similar to a binary tree, except that each node is either a leaf or has two children. The root of the heap is the smallest value in the tree.
*  [Graph](graph.md) - Graph is a data structure that is used to represent a network of nodes. Each node is connected to a set of other nodes, which are called its neighbors. Graphs are used to represent networks of computers, social networks, and other networks.
* [Trie](trie.md) - Trie is a data structure that is used to store strings. It is similar to a binary search tree, except that it is optimized for string searches.
* [Hash table](hash-table.md) - Hash table is a data structure that is used to store data. It is similar to an
